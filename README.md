# Face Detection

This program uses OpenCV and Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to identify faces, eyes, and mouths in a live webcam.

## Important Notes

* You may need to change the path of the _.xml_ files.
* These files contain the necessary features that the program uses to detect faces.
